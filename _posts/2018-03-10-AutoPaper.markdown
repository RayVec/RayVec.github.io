This is a project about paper writing that I am currently working on. The function is to convert randomly typeset papers into a standard paper format. The framework used is Java’s POI. I have studied it for April before and after. The study on April is The principles of compilation and the idea of ​​pattern recognition. At present, the main functions have been completed. In order to improve the rationality, deep learning technology is needed, and hunting has not been involved.

The specific implementation process is introduced here that cannot be resolved much, mainly using POI to analyze a word document hierarchically, and finally build a tree, thereby forming a recast article structure.
