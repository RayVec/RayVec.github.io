# Background


College students often have situations where they need to form a team in their study and life. Whether it is completing major assignments assigned by the teacher or participating in various competitions, they need suitable teammates to fight side by side. For example, project experience is a very important item on college students’ resumes, so college students have a great demand for team formation in competitions. The traditional way of team formation is generally to find teammates through their own contacts. The disadvantages of this method are very great. Obviously, for example, a student of the School of Computer Science, and the people he knows are all classmates of the school, it may be difficult to find an excellent student of the School of Urban Design as an art teammate. Before us, other teams have seen this pain point. Their solution is to provide a supply and demand platform to find teammates by posting posts, and our team creatively introduced "matching" to solve this need. The concept of "matching" originates from the game, that is, the game system will automatically find players who are similar to your level to form a game. Similarly, replace the game with a competition. What our product has to solve is how to find a programmer who needs art. And an artist who needs a programmer, when they send out matching requirements at the same time, match them into a team.


# Goal


Aiming at the team formation needs of college students, we have developed a convenient and quick APP to provide a platform for the majority of students to form teams.


# 产品功能说明

# 开发说明


本次产品开发我们划分了前端小组与后台小组，分工明确有利于项目进度的统筹安排。但是这种分组可能会碰到前端与后台相互等待进度的情况，比如前端页面需要调用的接口后台还没实现，或后台进度过快，不知道前台该需要什么接口参数。对此，我们可以前后端加强沟通，后台先写出假接口为前端进行测试使用。
