# Background


College students often have situations where they need to form a team in their study and life. Whether it is completing major assignments assigned by the teacher or participating in various competitions, they need suitable teammates to fight side by side. For example, project experience is a very important item on college students’ resumes, so college students have a great demand for team formation in competitions. The traditional way of team formation is generally to find teammates through their own contacts. The disadvantages of this method are very great. Obviously, for example, a student of the School of Computer Science, and the people he knows are all classmates of the school, it may be difficult to find an excellent student of the School of Urban Design as an art teammate. Before us, other teams have seen this pain point. Their solution is to provide a supply and demand platform to find teammates by posting posts, and our team creatively introduced "matching" to solve this need. The concept of "matching" originates from the game, that is, the game system will automatically find players who are similar to your level to form a game. Similarly, replace the game with a competition. What our product has to solve is how to find a programmer who needs art. And an artist who needs a programmer, when they send out matching requirements at the same time, match them into a team.


# Goal


Aiming at the team formation needs of college students, we have developed a convenient and quick APP to provide a platform for the majority of students to form teams.


# Features


The function is broken down into four levels of content:


The first layer is the basic function, which can realize the establishment of a round table and matching by a single person, realize the basic functions of chatting, preparation and team formation in the round table, and can display the round table.


The second layer is to increase the friend function and multi-person team, add friends, invite friends in demand, and notify in the message interface after inviting friends, increase the round table draft function, which can be used when the user temporarily gives up the need to write and launch a round table save.


The third layer is the improvement of social functions, involving private chats between friends, adding official notification messages, and a dedicated display interface for friends.


The fourth layer is to upgrade the communication platform after the round table meets the team function. The round table that has been formed is upgraded to the team that can communicate for a long time, and the related interfaces need to be modified.

# Development introduction


In this product development, we divided the front-end team and the back-end team, and the clear division of labor is conducive to the overall arrangement of the project schedule. However, this type of grouping may encounter situations where the front end and the back end are waiting for progress. For example, the interface that the front end page needs to call has not yet been implemented in the background, or the background progress is too fast. I don't know what interface parameters the front end needs. In this regard, we can strengthen communication between the front and back ends, and write out fake interfaces for the front end for testing in the background.
